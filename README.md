## Description
Are you ready to dive right into one of the most exciting developments in data science right now: Google’s breakthrough NLP algorithm, BERT!

Testing your skills with practical courses is one of the best and most enjoyable ways to learn data science…and now we’re giving you that chance for FREE.

Our new case study course: Natural Language Processing (NLP) with BERT shows you how to perform semantic analysis on movie reviews using data from one of the most visited websites in the world: IMDB!

Perform semantic analysis on a large dataset of movie reviews using the low-code Python library, Ktrain.

But, why is BERT so revolutionary?

Not only is it a framework that has been pre-trained with the biggest data set ever used, it is also remarkably easy to adapt to different NLP applications, by adding additional output layers. This allows users to create sophisticated and precise models to carry out a wide variety of NLP tasks.

AI expert Hadelin de Ponteves guides you through some basic components of Natural Language Processing, how to implement the BERT model and sentiment analysis, and finally, Python coding in Google Colab.

Here’s how this 1-hour case study course will unfold:

### Part 1: Data Preprocessing

* Loading the IMDB dataset

* Creating the training and test sets

### Part 2: Building the BERT model

### Part 3: Training and evaluating the BERT model

* Getting the learner instance

* Training and evaluating the BERT model

Plus, you’ll do it all using Google’s Colab free, browser-based notebook environment that runs completely in the cloud. It’s a game-changing interface that will save you time and supercharge your data science toolkit.
